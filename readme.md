### Where can I see your demo?
You can find my demo in Github.com by following the link that I wrote above.

### What was your experience?
I experienced that redux works similarly as context. I also experienced that having style component makes your life easier.

### What have you learned/improved?
I learned more how to work with style component and compound component which made me struggled a lot to understand before. I also learn more about redux which is a lesson thing for me. I still need to learn more about logic in redux because there are still a lot of thing that I am not really familiar with such as updating form in redux.

-   Your wisdom? :)
I think it is really important to have clean and well named code.
